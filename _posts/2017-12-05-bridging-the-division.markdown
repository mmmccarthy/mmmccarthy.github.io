### Implementing Complete Streets: Division between Ashland and Orleans 

In the Fall 2017 Implementing Complete Streets class, I worked with a team of 3 other Urban Planning students to create a plan for Division Street around the changing Goose Island area.

Our plan, "Bridging the Division," sought to develop stronger connections between the existing vibrant neighborhoods that touch Division. Improved on-street bike and pedestrian infrastructure, coupled with changes in zoning and land use around Goose Island, would make walking and biking more comfortable from West Town to Old Town.

In our observations, many bicyclists were already using Division, which has comfortable bike lanes west of the study area. However, we also saw bicyclists using the sidewalks to get around congested segments near the Kennedy Expressway and to avoid railroad tracks on Goose Island.

Overall, we found that new bike lanes through most of the corridor could be accomodated by slimming existing wide traffic lanes and that walking could be made more comfortable with lighting, street furniture, and ultimately with more pedestrian-oriented future land uses.
