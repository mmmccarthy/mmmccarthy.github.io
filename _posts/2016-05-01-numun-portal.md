At Northwestern, I was involved in **Northwestern University Model United Nations** (NUMUN) as a member and later Technology Director and VP of Technology Operations.

NUMUN convenes hundreds of high school students at its annual conference to debate and discuss major international issues through Model United Nations. The conference can't happen without a registration system and a robust customer experience.

Drawing on my web design skills and a desire to learn more about website development and coding, I started the NUMUN Portal project in 2014 as a simple site to handle registration and invoicing for the conference. Since then, the project has grown into a central communication and data hub for conference organizers and attending schools.

The system is used by schools to register, view invoices, and create student rosters. NUMUN staff uses it to assign positions, track payments, and publish background guides on debate topics.

The NUMUN Portal is written in PHP.
