DataTrack is a data analysis tool created for *Innovation in Journalism* (Fall 2013) with Amon Jones and Tom Saxton.

The tool is meant to help journalists quickly identify trends in large datasets, such as those found on Chicago&apos;s Data Portal. With an automated tool, journalists could spend less time wrangling data and crunching numbers and more time investigating the reasons why something is happening.
