title:  "Andersonville downzoning would lead to population loss, fewer affordable housing units"
---

The 47th Ward Zoning Advisory Council (ZAC) and Ald. Matt Martin are considering a proposal to downzone part of Andersonville from RT-4 to RS-3. Essentially, this would limit new housing to mostly single-family homes in an area known for its housing density, walkability, access to restauarants and small businesses, and proximity to 24-hour, frequent public transit.

I **oppose** the rezoning proposal outright. I want to address some of the points made by those backing the proposal. I feel a need to respond because the proponents are using my work to back their idea.
