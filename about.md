Hi, I'm Michael. I'm an urban planner working to make cities smarter, greener, safer, and more equitable, especially in the transportation field.

I recently graduated with a Master's in Urban Planning and Policy and earned a Public Transit Planning and Management certificate from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC).
