title:  "Andersonville downzoning would lead to population loss, fewer affordable housing units"
---

The 47th Ward Zoning Advisory Council (ZAC) and Ald. Matt Martin are considering a proposal to downzone part of Andersonville from RT-4 to RS-3. Essentially, this would limit new housing to mostly single-family homes in an area known for its housing density, walkability, access to restauarants and small businesses, and proximity to 24-hour, frequent public transit.

I **oppose** the rezoning proposal outright. I want to address some of the points made by those backing the proposal. I feel a need to respond because the proponents are using my work to back their idea.

## Properties Affected by Rezoning
Properties shown in orange on the map below would be affected by the proposal and downzoned to RS-3. Properties in blue are either already RS-3 or excluded from the downzoning because they are in B (Business) or C (Commercial) zones or a PD (Planned Development).

## Downzoning would not Preserve Historic Buildings 

## Existing "Neighborhood Character" is Dense

## Current Buildings align with Existing Zoning 

## Loss of Population

## Process
### Gather Data
* City of Chicago Zoning Districts - includes zone class (B, C, RT-4, RS-3, etc.)
* City of Chicago Building Footprints - includes # of stories and other characteristics

### Select Zoning Districts in the "SoFoZoCo" area

### Spatial Join Buildings to Zoning Districts

### Select Buildings in the "SoFoZoCo" area
I wasn't sure what "south side of Argyle" meant since Argyle is quite complicated here. Many of the buildings don't face Argyle. If they don't how far down the block is included? I decided to select up to Ainslie to include all the possible intended buildings.
