The *Resilient City Plan* was created by UIC Master in Urban Planning and Policy (MUPP) students in the Spring 2018 Plan-making Studio.

The plan looks 20 years into the future to predict and remediate negative impacts of "The 78" mega-development in the South Loop. In the context of increasing income inequality and decreasing home affordability, the plan serves as a template for preserving affected communities like Pilsen and Chinatown without rejecting new development outright. Instead the goal is to include all of Chicago&apos;s communities in the city&apos;s prosperity.

> As such, the [plan document] serves as an equity plan for the communities within 64 census tracts surrounding the development site. The Resilient City Plan analyzes existing conditions, forecasts future trends, and ultimately, proposes a set of community-centric initiatives for preserving local ownership of our neighborhoods, businesses, homes and public spaces that can sustain through the year 2048 and beyond.
